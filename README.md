```

### Working with Test Sets

```python
from rhesis.entities import TestSet

# List all test sets
for test_set in TestSet().all():
    print(test_set)

# Load a specific test set
test_set = TestSet(id="agent-or-industry-fraud-harmful")
test_set.load()

# Download test set data
test_set.download()

```
